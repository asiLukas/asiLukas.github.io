            <p><strong><i>Winter 2022</i></strong></p>
            <p>My first project with a separate backend and frontend. The application currently allows
              adding / editing / removing posts and
              includes a chat where users can enter a room code to join a chat room and communicate in real-time.
              All messages are stored in a database, so upon rejoining a room, all previous messages are loaded. There
              is also an option to chat while not being logged in as an anonymous.</p>
